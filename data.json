Nanami's brother and Makoto's lifelong rival, the unscrupulous student council president Katsuhiko Jinnai, is under scrutiny for mishandling the school festival planning and is convinced that Makoto is plotting to steal his position. One night, as Makoto and Nanami are taking a break with their teacher Masamichi Fujisawa, Jinnai sneaks into the science lab and sabotages Makoto's device, which suddenly opens a portal that flings all four of them into another world!\nUpon arrival, Makoto is immediately attacked by a horde of giant bug monsters. While running from them, he comes across Fujisawa and a girl named Rune Venus. After Fujisawa fights off the monsters, a group of dignitaries arrives, looking for Rune, their princess. They inform Makoto and Fujisawa that they are in a world called El-Hazard and take them back to the palace of Roshtaria, their kingdom. Though her advisors are suspicious of the newcomers, Rune decrees that they are to be treated as guests and quickly befriends Makoto. Unaware that Nanami and Jinnai are in this world as well, Makoto gets to work trying to figure out a way back to Earth.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Suddenly, during the chase, time stops for everyone-except Makoto.

Upon arrival, the two encounter hostile slave traders and barely escape with the help of Tamahome-a powerful young man bearing a Chinese symbol on his forehead. But, a moment later, the red light returns and takes Yui away.\nDesperate to reunite with her companion, Miaka asks Tamahome for assistance. However, the situation escalates when the pair encounters the land's emperor, Hotohori, who believes Miaka is the foretold priestess of the kingdom's protector god Suzaku. By gathering the god's seven Celestial Warriors, the priestess can summon Suzaku and have all her wishes granted. Hotohori hopes this will save his country, and since it appears to be a fitting solution to the girl's problems as well, he convinces her to accept the role.\nMeanwhile, at the library, Yui realizes she has been brought back alone. Unable to intervene, she helplessly witnesses Miaka traversing through courageous trials as the mysterious book's heroine.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Thanks to a premonition from Hitomi, Van successfully kills the dragon, but a pillar of light appears and envelopes them both. As a result, Hitomi finds herself transported to the world of Gaea, a mysterious land where the Earth hangs in the sky.\nIn this new land, Hitomi soon discovers that Van is a prince of the Kingdom of Fanelia, which soon falls under attack by the evil empire of Zaibach. In an attempt to fight them off, Van boards his family's ancient guymelef Escaflowne-a mechanized battle suit-but fails to defeat them, and Fanelia ends up destroyed. Now on the run, Hitomi and Van encounter a handsome Asturian knight named Allen Schezar, whom Hitomi is shocked to find looks exactly like her crush from Earth. With some new allies on their side, Van and Hitomi fight back against the forces of Zaibach as the empire strives to revive an ancient power.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When the elven priestess Celcia Marieclaire casts the spell to send them home, she is interrupted, and the spell is broken into parts that scatter throughout the world. The spell fragments imprint themselves onto the skin of various elves.\nThe trio travels in Ritsuko's tank, searching for elves who might carry the spell fragments so that Celcia can transfer them to her own body and make the spell whole again. As they adventure, people begin to refer to them as \"Those Who Hunt Elves,\" gaining a reputation as warriors that put a stop to evil-doers with their miraculous cannon, terrifying elves by stripping any that they find. Though they're not the smartest group, they make up for it with enthusiasm and their strong determination to get back to Japan.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Soon, the group discovers that this world known as \"X-Zone\" revolves around Idaten battles-MTB races characterized by special courses, rules, and hidden powers lying dormant within the bikes. The only way to return home is to win and obtain the MTB emblems from the defeated challengers.\nDespite being perplexed and terrified of the bizarre world, Shou is surprisingly excited. He has the opportunity to compete with fellow MTB riders, make new friends and rivals, and also unearth the X-Zone's hidden truths that may dramatically change his fate. Shou and his friends must make it through an arduous journey, one rife with conspiracies against them, in order to safely return home together.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

There, she meets her friends Umi Ryuuzaki and Fuu Hououji for the first time since their spontaneous quest to save Cephiro. Plagued by nightmares of the realm she had left behind, Hikaru is relieved to find that her companions too want to return and serve the kingdom they once so dutifully protected.\nThe Magic Knights' wish is answered, for at the top of Tokyo Tower, the three are blinded by the same great light they had seen on the day they first met. Once more on the back of a flying fish, the group returns to Cephiro-a world now desolate and in ruins. With the collapse of the Pillar's power, monsters freely roam the land while three nations seek to annex Cephiro with hopes of seizing the Pillar for themselves. Complicating things further is the mysterious Lady Debonair, who proclaims herself to be the rightful heir of the fallen country.\nNow confronting graver stakes and radically different enemies, the three Magic Knights set forth once more to save Cephiro and bring peace. With the bonds they have forged together, the trio stands united in the face of such a great challenge.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Mario falls in love with her and vows to protect her. Soon after, Koopa appears on the TV screen and starts to come out of the TV. He grabs Princess Peach and takes her into the TV. Mario then discovers a small brooch that Peach left on the floor.\nThe next day, the brooch that Peach dropped becomes a matter of concern for Mario. Luigi immediately notices the brooch and regards it as the \"Visionary Jewel from the Country of Treasure\". Soon, Kibidango, a small dog-like being, wanders into the store and notices that Mario has Peach's brooch. He takes it away from Mario, enraging him, thus beginning his (and Luigi's) chase with Kibidango into the Mushroom Kingdom.\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

This means succubi are required to keep a harem of men close at hand. Ironically, Lotte despises men, which will put her life at risk once she matures. To convince her to fulfill her duties, one of her attendants, Judith Snorrevik, goes to the human realm to find a human male whom Lotte can tolerate.\nJudith returns with 23-year-old Naoya Touhara, a single father who unfortunately leaves his daughter, Asuha, behind in the human realm. As the first member of Lotte's harem, Naoya quickly adapts to this new environment, serving the princess to make her happy, rather than viewing her with sexual intent. Unfortunately, when his daughter is allowed to arrive in the magical realm, Naoya's relationship quickly worsens with Lotte. Even so, he strives to patch up their relationship.\nIt soon becomes clear, however, that Naoya's presence in the magical realm is more than just mere coincidence. As he develops his bond with Lotte, fate begins to pull together the connections that tie him and everyone else within this enchanting world.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The Republic of Biscotti, a union of dog-like citizens, has come under attack by the feline forces of the Galette Leo Knights. In an effort to save Biscotti, Princess Millhiore summons a champion from another world in order to defend her people. That champion is Cinque Izumi, a normal junior high student from Earth.\nAgreeing to assist Biscotti, Cinque retrieves a sacred weapon called the Palladion and prepares for war. In Flonyard, wars are fought with no casualties and are more akin to sports competitions with the goal of raising money for the participating kingdoms. Cinque is successful in his role as Biscotti's champion, but learns that a summoned champion cannot be returned to their home world. The scientists of Biscotti will endeavor to find a way for Cinque to return home, but until they figure something out, he must serve Princess Millhiore by continuing to fight as Biscotti's hero.",

Naruto is jealous of his comrades' congratulatory families, wishing for the presence of his own parents. Sakura, on the other hand, is angry at her embarrassing parents, and wishes for no parents at all. The two clash over their opposing ideals, but are faced with a more pressing matter when the masked Madara Uchiha suddenly appears and transports them to an alternate world.\nIn this world, Sakura's parents are considered heroes-for they gave their lives to protect Konohagakure from the Nine-Tailed Fox attack 10 years ago. Consequently, Naruto's parents, Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki, are alive and well. Unable to return home or find the masked Madara, Naruto and Sakura stay in this new world and enjoy the changes they have always longed for. All seems well for the two ninja, until an unexpected threat emerges that pushes Naruto and Sakura to not only fight for the Konohagakure of the alternate world, but also to find a way back to their own.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unbeknown to him, his grandmother had claimed him to be female at birth, and now, with no other girls to succeed the princess from the matriarchal Hime clan, he is next in line for the throne! Disguised as a woman awaiting a replacement to be found, Arata witnesses an assassination attempt on the princess by none other than her own guard, the 12 Shinsho. The crime is pinned on his head, forcing Arata to escape to the Kando forest, where it is said that no one comes out the same.\nMeanwhile, in modern-day Japan, Arata Hinohara longs for escape from the cruelty of his classmates. Hearing his name called from an alley, he wanders from his path and unwittingly switches universes with Arata from Amawakuni. With his own power as a newly awakened \"Sho\"-a warrior able to wield Hayagami, weapons with the power of the gods-and the help of his companions he meets along his journey, Hinohara sets out to restore order to this new world.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In a place where everything is decided through simple games, humankind seems to have no way out of their predicament-but the arrival of two outsiders poses a change.\nOn Earth, stepsiblings Sora and Shiro are two inseparable shut-ins who dominate various online games under the username \"Blank.\" While notorious on the internet, the pair believe that life is merely another dull game. However, after responding to a message from an unknown user, they are suddenly transported to Disboard. The mysterious sender turns out to be Tet, who informs them about the world's absolute rules. After Tet leaves, Sora and Shiro begin their search for more information and a place to stay, taking them to Elkia-Imanity's only remaining kingdom.\nThere, the duo encounters Stephanie Dola, an emotional girl vying for the kingdom's sovereignty. In desperation, she attempts to regain her father's throne, but her foolhardiness makes her goal unachievable. Inspired by the girl's motivation and passion, Sora and Shiro decide to aid Stephanie in getting Elkia back on its feet, ultimately aiming to become the new rulers of the enigmatic realm.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

For nine-year-old Ren, the last person who treated him with any form of kindness has been killed, and he is shunned by what is left of his family. With no parents, no real family, and no place to go, Ren escapes into the confusing streets and alleyways of Shibuya. Through the twists and turns of the alleys, Ren stumbles into the intimidating Kumatetsu, who leads him to the beast realm of Shibuten.\nFor Kumatetsu, the boy represents a chance for him to become a candidate to replace the lord of the realm once he retires. While nearly unmatched in combat, Kumatetsu's chilly persona leaves him with no disciples to teach and no way to prove he is worthy of becoming the lord's successor.\nWhile the two share different goals, they agree to help each other in order to reach them. Kumatetsu searches for recognition; Ren, now known as Kyuuta, searches for the home he never had. As the years pass by, it starts to become apparent that the two are helping each other in more ways than they had originally thought. Perhaps there has always been less of a difference between them, a boy and a beast, than either of the two ever realized.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

From this gate, supernatural creatures and warriors clad in medieval armor emerge, charging through the city, killing and destroying everything in their path. With swift actions, Youji saves as many lives as he can while the rest of the JSDF direct their efforts toward stopping the invasion.\nThree months after the attack, Youji has been tasked with leading a special recon team, as part of a JSDF task force, that will be sent to the world beyond the gate-now being referred to as the \"Special Region.\" They must travel into this unknown world in order to learn more about what they are dealing with and attempt to befriend the locals in hopes of creating peaceful ties with the ruling empire. But if they fail, they face the consequence of participating in a devastating war that will engulf both sides of the gate.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She provides the NEET with two options: continue on to heaven or reincarnate in every gamer's dream-a real fantasy world! Choosing to start a new life, Kazuma is quickly tasked with defeating a Demon King who is terrorizing villages. But before he goes, he can choose one item of any kind to aid him in his quest, and the future hero selects Aqua. But Kazuma has made a grave mistake-Aqua is completely useless!\nUnfortunately, their troubles don't end here; it turns out that living in such a world is far different from how it plays out in a game. Instead of going on a thrilling adventure, the duo must first work to pay for their living expenses. Indeed, their misfortunes have only just begun!\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Things are not looking good for the bewildered teenager; however, not long after his arrival, he is attacked by some thugs. Armed with only a bag of groceries and a now useless cell phone, he is quickly beaten to a pulp. Fortunately, a mysterious beauty named Satella, in hot pursuit after the one who stole her insignia, happens upon Subaru and saves him. In order to thank the honest and kindhearted girl, Subaru offers to help in her search, and later that night, he even finds the whereabouts of that which she seeks. But unbeknownst to them, a much darker force stalks the pair from the shadows, and just minutes after locating the insignia, Subaru and Satella are brutally murdered.\nHowever, Subaru immediately reawakens to a familiar scene-confronted by the same group of thugs, meeting Satella all over again-the enigma deepens as history inexplicably repeats itself.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Thrown into a foreign land with nothing but hazy memories and the knowledge of their name, they can feel only these three emotions resonating deep within their souls. A group of strangers is given no other choice than to accept the only paying job in this game-like world-the role of a soldier in the Reserve Army-and eliminate anything that threatens the peace in their new world, Grimgar.\nWhen all of the stronger candidates join together, those left behind must create a party together to survive: Manato, a charismatic leader and priest; Haruhiro, a nervous thief; Yume, a cheerful hunter; Shihoru, a shy mage; Moguzo, a kind warrior; and Ranta, a rowdy dark knight. Despite its resemblance to one, this is no game-there are no redos or respawns; it is kill or be killed.\nIt is now up to this ragtag group of unlikely fighters to survive together in a world where life and death are separated only by a fine line.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Hellbent on defiance, Tanya resolves to ascend the ranks of her country's military as it slowly plunges into world war, with only Being X proving to be the strongest obstacle in recreating the peaceful life she once knew.

After choosing the new world, the goddess Aqua tasked him with defeating the Demon King, and let him choose any weapon to aid him. Unfortunately, Kazuma chose to bring Aqua herself and has regretted the decision ever since then.\nNot only is he stuck with a useless deity turned party archpriest, the pair also has to make enough money for living expenses. To add to their problems, their group continued to grow as more problematic adventurers joined their ranks. Their token spellcaster, Megumin, is an explosion magic specialist who can only cast one spell once per day and refuses to learn anything else. There is also their stalwart crusader, Lalatina Ford \"Darkness\" Dustiness, a helpless masochist who makes Kazuma look pure in comparison.\nKono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! 2 continues to follow Kazuma and the rest of his party through countless more adventures as they struggle to earn money and have to deal with one another's problematic personalities. However, things rarely go as planned, and they are often sidetracked by their own idiotic tendencies.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In a lawless land, humanity's lack of magic and weak bodies have made them easy targets for the other Exceed, leaving the humans on the brink of extinction.\nOne day, however, hope returns to humanity when Riku finds a powerful female Ex-Machina, whom he names Schwi, in an abandoned elf city. Exiled from her Cluster because of her research into human emotions, Schwi is convinced that humanity has only survived due to the power of these feelings and is determined to understand the human heart. Forming an unlikely partnership in the midst of the overwhelming chaos, Riku and Schwi must now find the answers to their individual shortcomings in each other, and discover for themselves what it truly means to be human as they fight for their lives together against all odds. Each with a powerful new ally in tow, it is now up to them to prevent the extinction of the human race and establish peace throughout Disboard.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Forced to cast a powerful spell in retaliation, Satou wipes them out completely and his level is boosted to 310, effectively maximizing his stats.

Melromarc is a country plagued by the Waves of Catastrophe that have repeatedly ravaged the land and brought disaster to its citizens for centuries. The four heroes are respectively bestowed a sword, spear, bow, and shield to vanquish these Waves. Naofumi Iwatani, an otaku, becomes cursed with the fate of being the \"Shield Hero.\" Armed with only a measly shield, Naofumi is belittled and ridiculed by his fellow heroes and the kingdom's people due to his weak offensive capabilities and lackluster personality.\nWhen the heroes are provided with resources and comrades to train with, Naofumi sets out with the only person willing to train alongside him, Malty Melromarc. He is soon betrayed by her, however, and becomes falsely accused of taking advantage of her. Naofumi then becomes heavily discriminated against and hated by the people of Melromarc for something he didn't do. With a raging storm of hurt and mistrust in his heart, Naofumi begins his journey of strengthening himself and his reputation. Further along however, the difficulty of being on his own sets in, so Naofumi buys a demi-human slave on the verge of death named Raphtalia to accompany him on his travels.\nAs the Waves approach the kingdom, Naofumi and Raphtalia must fight for the survival of the kingdom and protect the people of Melromarc from their ill-fated future.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Preferring a quiet life however, he secludes himself deep in the rural woods, dedicating his time to raising an orphan that he saved. This orphan is Shin, a normal salaryman in modern-day Japan who was reincarnated into Merlin's world while still retaining his past memories. As the years pass, Shin displays unparalleled talent in both magic casting and martial arts, much to Merlin's constant amazement.\nOn his 15th birthday, however, it becomes apparent that Shin only developed his combat skills and nothing else, leaving him with blatant social awkwardness, a lack of common sense, and a middling sense of responsibility. As a result, Shin enrolls in the kingdom's Magic Academy to hone his skills and mature among other teenagers. However, living a normal life is impossible, as he is established as a local celebrity almost as soon as he arrives.\nAs Shin Wolford adjusts to his high school life in the capital, he makes new friends, learns about the world, and fights off the various forces of evil surrounding him and his city.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They take Mahito out of Tokyo to seek refuge in his late mother's rural family home. There, Mahito is constantly taunted by a strange gray heron, who seems to have taken an interest in him.\nUnable to come to terms with his loss and struggling to adjust to a new life in an unfamiliar place, the boy is shocked to discover that Natsuko is pregnant. To make matters worse, the pesky heron can speak-and claims that Mahito's mother is still alive. Luring him into a mysterious tower near the residence, the heron says that Mahito can save her from death, but the boy is not easily swayed.\nWhen Natsuko disappears one day, however, Mahito watches her walk into the tower and becomes compelled to venture in to rescue her. He soon finds himself falling into another world below his, where life and death seem to be entwined. As he navigates through this foreign realm to find Natsuko, Mahito must understand what it means to live if he wants to safely return home.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After securing victory over the remnants of the Republic's army, the Empire's ultimate victory is finally within reach. However, dark clouds are gathering in the East. The communist-led Russy Federation is mustering troops on its western border, preparing to enter the war. Supported by a detachment of Allied volunteer magicians-among whom is Mary Sioux, the daughter of a soldier killed by Tanya von Degurechaff-the Federation is determined to spread the communist creed and bring the Empire to its knees.\nMeanwhile, Tanya and her battalion return to the imperial capital from the southern front. Upon their arrival, they are tasked with investigating troop movements on the border with the Federation. Any escalation of violence at this point may lead to new conflicts, plunging the world into a devastating global war.\nWill the Empire eventually emerge victorious from its struggle, or will it crumble in the face of superior enemies and radically different ideologies?\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In the midst of a casual encounter with his colleague, he falls victim to a random assailant on the streets and is stabbed. However, while succumbing to his injuries, a peculiar voice echoes in his mind, and recites a bunch of commands which the dying man cannot make sense of.\nWhen Satoru regains consciousness, he discovers that he has reincarnated as a goop of slime in an unfamiliar realm. In doing so, he acquires newfound skills-notably, the power to devour anything and mimic its appearance and abilities. He then stumbles upon the sealed Catastrophe-level monster \"Storm Dragon\" Veldora who had been sealed away for the past 300 years for devastating a town to ashes. Sympathetic to his predicament, Satoru befriends him, promising to assist in destroying the seal. In return, Veldora bestows upon him the name Rimuru Tempest to grant him divine protection.\nNow, liberated from the mundanities of his past life, Rimuru embarks on a fresh journey with a distinct goal in mind. As he grows accustomed to his new physique, his gooey antics ripple throughout the world, gradually altering his fate.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Now, they depart for their most dangerous destination yet: a civilization in the Age of Gods, B.C. 2655 Mesopotamia. Ritsuka and Mash soon discover that Demonic Beasts roam the land, attacking people and towns. Amidst chaos and terror lies humanity's last defense-Uruk, a fortress city that acts as the frontline for the battle against the beasts. The battlefront is commanded by none other than King Gilgamesh, the King of Heroes, who sought aid from Heroic Spirits and took on the role of a mage to protect his city.\nAlong with Gilgamesh and the summoned servants, Ritsuka and Mash must protect Uruk against the magical beasts' onslaught and defeat the Three Goddess Alliance who aims to eradicate humankind; all the while, a greater threat looms over Uruk, preparing for its awakening.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After being summoned by the goddess Ristarte to save the world of Gaeabrande from destruction, the hero prepares himself for his noble journey. While this might be normal, he spends a very long time training himself, despite having overpowered stats. He fights weak enemies using his strongest skills and buys excessive amounts of supplies and potions-all to stay safe.\nWhile his attitude may be a bit annoying, it might just be the saving grace of Gaeabrande, especially considering that it is a world where the forces of evil dominate each and every expectation.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Shen Yuan has read enough xianxia novels to know that the protagonist will somehow cultivate the demonic path, take revenge on his scumbag master, and gain a massive harem along the way. So when he unexpectedly transmigrates into the world of Proud Immortal Demon Way, he knows exactly how the story is going to proceed. However, he does not get to play the role of the protagonist, but instead he becomes the scumbag master destined to suffer a humiliating defeat.\nShen Yuan, now known as cultivation master Shen Qingqiu, makes it his mission to change his fate so that he does not fall to his disciple, Luo Binghe, the protagonist of the novel. Trying to break away from the cruel personality of the original Shen Qingqiu seems impossible as any uncharacteristic behavior is blocked by a monitoring system meant to keep him from derailing the plot.\nShen Yuan must find a way to befriend Luo Binghe so that he has no reason to seek revenge on his teacher in the future. But with the set series of tragedies meant to befall the protagonist at the hands of Shen Qingqiu, this teacher has his work cut out for him.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, however, a suspicious man pursues and stabs Kotona-a catastrophe that Yuu and Haru fail to prevent. While hastily carrying the girl to the hospital, the two boys are nearly hit by a truck but miraculously remain unharmed.

Yet they have no time to ponder the puzzling situation, as their friend is gone. Setting off to find Kotona, Yuu and Haru stop at a local pub to inquire about her. But upon inspecting a picture of Asha, the kingdom's princess, the two have a shocking revelation.\nNarrating an extraordinary adventure in a magical world, Ni no Kuni demonstrates the special connection between two separate yet parallel worlds and its manifestation of the bonds between individuals.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After being rescued by the byuma Winona and her adopted elven daughter Lyrule, the group pledges to use their advanced skills and knowledge to pay back the people of Elm Village for their hospitality and find a way to return back home.\nTsukasa Mikogami, the prime minister of Japan, acts as the leader of these young geniuses and organizes their efforts to intervene in Freyjagard and gather the information and resources necessary for achieving their goals. Believing that there is a connection between their current situation and an ancient legend about seven heroes from another world who defeated an evil dragon, Tsukasa directs the others to learn about the culture around them and search for any clues leading them back to Earth. But he also gives another instruction: to take it nice and easy, lest they ruin this world by giving it their all.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Naofumi is spurred back into action when Queen Mirelia Q Melromarc tells him that the three other Cardinal Heroes have disappeared without a trace, and she tasks him with finding them.\nWith no clues regarding their whereabouts, Naofumi tackles a more pressing issue: the worsening slave trade of demi-humans. Determined to right this injustice, he and his friends find their way to Zeltoble, the country of mercenaries, where the illegal sale of demi-humans has become a lucrative business. To gather money to free the slaves, Naofumi and his comrades disguise themselves and take part in underground coliseum brawls, purposely throwing matches to manipulate the odds and eventually secure an enormous payout. However, with the threat of another Wave of Catastrophe looming on the horizon, the Shield Hero must stick to his mission of finding the missing heroes if he wants to protect those he loves.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "In role-playing games, slimes are usually the easiest monster to kill, and because of that, they yield few experience points. But what would happen if you live long enough to keep defeating them for 300 years?\nAfter many years of being a corporate slave, Azusa Aizawa abruptly passes away due to severe exhaustion. Seemingly headed for the afterlife, she meets a goddess who bestows her with immortality alongside a peaceful life in another world. There, Azusa enjoys her days tending to her farm, protecting the nearby village, and killing about 25 slimes per day-a routine that continues for at least three centuries.\nHowever, this rather monotonous cycle begins to change when Azusa suddenly finds out that she has reached level 99-the maximum possible level-from slimes alone. Despite desperately trying to hide this fact in fear of ending her slow life, rumors of her strength spread nevertheless. Soon enough, various people throughout the continent, like the dragon Laika and the elf Halkara, start to appear at her doorstep-some seeking a battle, others asking for her assistance. Meeting friends and acquaintances who soon become family, Azusa finds she can live a life far better with others than when she was alone.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "When Myne learns that the Holy Church is in need of mana for their relics, she sees it as her chance to be cured of her life-threatening mana disorder. After seeing their bountiful library, she throws herself headfirst into the Church's grasp and begs to join their order. In exchange for her service and her unusually bountiful supply of mana, Myne is given the blue robes of a noble-born apprentice priestess, despite being a commoner. To Myne, all this talk of mana and nobility is trivial, as she now has access to an unlimited supply of books!\nAs Myne transitions into the next phase of her life in this new world, she soon learns that achieving her dream has come at a heavy cost. Noble society is severe, unforgiving, and fueled by politics and neglect. She must now deal with the class conflict between the noble-born blue robes and the common-born grey robes, the High Priest's attempts to oust her, and constant behavioral issues from her new retainers. With the help of her family, friends, and the enigmatic Head Priest whose loyalties and motives remain unknown, Myne seeks to overcome these obstacles and continue on the path to becoming her ideal self-the ultimate librarian!\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After accepting the bear equipment, she finds herself transported to another in-game world that prevents her from returning to reality.\nConfused and unable to log out, Yuna sets out to explore this new environment. She rescues a girl named Fina from wild wolves, who then guides her to the city of Crimonia. With her eccentric bear attire, however, Yuna stands out wherever she goes, and alongside her boosted fighting prowess, her reputation quickly rises-to the point that people give her the nickname \"Bloody Bear.\"\nUndeterred by this change in her life, Yuna decides to take on the role of an adventurer and fully enjoy herself in her new world.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Yuusuke Yotsuya has always disliked Tokyo, but he especially hates the people who live in it. He would rather thrive in a virtual world than try to get along with those around him. At the end of one school day, he sees the popular athlete Iu Shindou talking to Kusue Hakozaki, who spends less time in school due to illness. But when he looks away from the two and back again, they have seemingly disappeared.\nMere moments later, Yotsuya enters a state of free-fall, and the world begins to change around him. Dropping into a large pool of water, the first thing he sees when he comes to his senses is an assortment of enormous monsters. He soon finds out that he has been brought into a game world by Shindou and Hakozaki and that he must complete a quest within 14 days.\nThere is one thing that separates this world from the real world: anyone who dies will be brought back to life in 30 seconds as long as one party member is alive. Tasked with numerous quests that increase in difficulty over time, Yotsuya, Shindou, and Hakozaki attempt to discover the mystery behind the perplexing game world.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To witness its desolate yet oddly absorbing environment, one must search for portals that could reside anywhere, from secret elevators to shrine entrances.\nAfter a fateful encounter with a horrendous Otherworld denizen, Sorawo Kamikoshi ponders whether to keep going or give up in life. Meanwhile, Toriko Nishina scours the Otherworld in hopes of finding her friend Satsuki, who she believes is lost somewhere within the realm.\nWhen the two cross paths, friendship blossoms. In order to acquire as much information about this obscure dimension, the two travel back and forth from the real world to the other. Sorawo and Toriko's bodies are soon influenced by the Otherworld, preparing them for the many horrors to come as both of them try to fulfill their goals.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Out of the blue, he is transported to the Elfrieden Kingdom, a small ailing country in another world, to be a \"hero.\" An ongoing war with the demon army has put the entire world in peril, and Kazuya was summoned to aid in the conflict as an offering from Elfrieden to its allies.\nDissatisfied with being used as tribute, Kazuya decides to help the kingdom revamp its declining economy-not by way of adventuring or war, but through administrative reform. Abruptly declared the King of Elfrieden and betrothed to the princess, the \"Realist Hero\" Kazuya sets out to assemble a group of talented citizens who will assist him in his bureaucratic battles to get the kingdom back on its feet.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, while pleasuring himself as usual, his erotic magazine begins to glow and Naoki suddenly finds himself in a fantastic world. He appears among three female adventurers who later present themselves as the swordswoman Filia Shiora, the priestess Tiane Rutheim, and the elf Llusse. They explain to Naoki that the world is in danger of destruction due to the resurrection of the Demon King, and the only way to save it is for him to use his special power-feeding his semen to the three girls so as to increase their strength exponentially. Of course, the young hero agrees to join the party, and his erotic quest begins.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But one day, Dunbalf and the other Nine Wise Mages suddenly go missing, leaving no trace behind.\nIn an effort to spend his expiring credits, Dunbalf had purchased a cosmetic kit and tinkered with his character; however, he accidentally fell asleep during the customization process. Upon waking up, Dunbalf not only notices that the world of Ark Earth Online has become more realistic, but also discovers that he has turned into a cute girl! After reaching Alcait, he learns it has been 30 years since he supposedly disappeared.\nNow tasked with finding the other missing mages by King Solomon, the avid role player proclaims his new identity as Mira-the Pupil of the Wise Man Dunbalf-and ventures forth to prove his legacy.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Since ancient times, the citizens of Slantania have lived within a shroud of miasma, a force that brings forth monsters creating havoc around the world. When the kingdom's Order of Knights becomes incapable of containing the monsters, the Grand Magus summons a holy maiden-the legendary \"Saint\"-to obliterate the horrid creatures and restore peace.\nOne evening, as Sei Takanashi returns home from a long day at work, a magical force pulls her into a foreign world. Upon her arrival to the kingdom of Slantania, she overhears that the Grand Magus inadvertently summoned two Saints-Sei and a brown-haired girl. Needing only one holy maiden, the prince declares the other girl as the Saint, leaving Sei to her own devices.\nSei sets her sight on the Medicinal Flora Research Institute, an establishment known for its studies regarding herbs and potions. While indulging in her latest passion, Sei has a fateful encounter with the commander of the Third Order of Knights. But little does she know, her aptitude as a Saint will continue to exert its influence over her new life.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, the deity deems Makoto to be \"hideous,\" refusing to even lay eyes upon him and revokes his heroic title. Disdainfully giving him the ability to understand all languages except the human language as compensation, the goddess drives Makoto off to the farthest edges of the wasteland, far from human civilization.\nDue to the disparity between Earth and this new world, Makoto's inherent physical and magical capabilities awaken, making him extremely powerful. He meets various demihumans and mythical beings who all end up being captivated with his characteristics and join Makoto in building a new community where all of them can peacefully coexist.\nNevertheless, despite this success, Makoto still yearns to meet fellow humans. In a world where the goddess herself has barred him from interacting with his kind, it is up to Makoto and his companions to fulfill his desire-and perhaps reform society along the way.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, as their journey to the island commences, the team shortly finds that the quest is not as simple as it initially seemed.\nIn fact, the island is terrorized by orcs that have made a deal with its inhabitants: instead of devouring the islanders, the orcs will be granted buffalo.

There, they team up with their newfound companion Ruijerd Supardia-the former leader of the Superd's Warrior group-to form \"Dead End,\" a successful adventurer party. Making a name for themselves, the trio journeys across the continent to make their way back home to Fittoa.\nFollowing the advice he received from the faceless god Hitogami, Rudeus saves Kishirika Kishirisu, the Great Emperor of the Demon World, who rewards him by granting him a strange power. Now, as Rudeus masters the powerful ability that offers a number of new opportunities, it might prove to be more than what he bargained for when unexpected dangers threaten to hinder their travels.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

There, they will be given special skills in the hopes that they become that world's heroes and defeat the Demon King that ravages the land.\nThe initial transfer is a success. However, Seiichi Hiiragi, who suffers from his classmates' constant bullying due to his somewhat undesirable appearance, is left behind as no one is willing to be his teammate. Nevertheless, the self-proclaimed god decides to send Seiichi to the parallel world and lets him join his peers. Unfortunately, this fateful ordeal causes Seiichi to arrive at a location deep in the forest, far not only from his schoolmates but from human civilization as well.\nDesperately searching for a way to change his predicament, Seiichi's miserable days only seem to continue to worsen. Yet when all hope seems lost, Seiichi discovers a strange fruit known as the \"Fruit of Evolution\"-which may be his first step toward a significantly better future.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, despite his loyalty, that very same organization takes action to silence him, ultimately leading to his demise. Drowning in frustration and regrets he can no longer suppress, he finds himself in an audience with a goddess attracted by his exceptional skills. The goddess offers him reincarnation into a magnificent world of swords and magic so he can perform a crucial mission: prevent that world's destruction by slaying its hero.\nAccepting the goddess' request, he is reborn as Lugh Tuatha D&eacute;, the son of a noble family of assassins serving the Alvan Kingdom. Under the guidance of his father, Lugh learns new assassination techniques that significantly differ from the cold-blooded and unsympathetic killing style of his previous life. Furthermore, his other talents bloom, allowing him to meet new allies and acquaintances. Even so, Lugh knows that his efforts are far from adequate, because a monumental adversary such as the hero can only be defeated with perfection.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "For as long as he can remember, Minoru Kagenou has been fixated on becoming as strong as possible, which has led him to undertake all kinds of rigorous training. This wish, however, does not stem from a desire to be recognized by others; rather, Minoru does everything he can to blend in with the crowd. So, while pretending to be a completely average student during the day, he arms himself with a crowbar and ruthlessly thrashes local biker gangs at night. Yet when Minoru finds himself in a truck accident, his ambitions seemingly come to a sudden end. In his final moments, he laments his powerlessness-no matter how much he trained, there was nothing he could do to overcome his human limitations.\nBut instead of dying, Minoru reawakens as Cid, the second child of the noble Kagenou family, in another world-one where magic is commonplace. With the power he so desired finally within his grasp, he dons the moniker \"Shadow\" and establishes Shadow Garden: a group whose sole purpose is to combat the enigmatic Cult of Diablos, an organization born from Cid's imagination. However, as Shadow Garden grows in both membership and influence, it becomes increasingly apparent that the Cult of Diablos is not as fictional as Cid had intended.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In Japan, the restaurant appears to be closed on Saturdays, but in actuality, it is the one day that Nekoya transcends to the Other World and opens its doors to guests seeking foreign cuisine. From castles to forests, the \"Restaurant to Another World\"-as its patrons call it-travels far and wide.\nNekoya's diverse and bizarre clientele can expect to be greeted by one of two devoted waitresses-the courteous demon waitress Aletta, or the enigmatic and elven Kuro. As customers, both old and new, pile into the establishment with stories of their respective lands, Master and his staff ensure that everyone is in for a scrumptious adventure of a lifetime.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, while Jinguuji has never shown interest in the opposite sex, Tachibana is always desperate for a girlfriend. Despite their polar differences, they continue to be best friends even in their thirties as salarymen.\nOne night, the two are returning home from a mixer where Jinguuji was the center of attention as usual. In his drunken rambles, a frustrated Tachibana inadvertently wishes to become a beautiful girl with irresistible charm. As if the heavens were listening, a goddess suddenly shows herself before Jinguuji and Tachibana, transporting them to another world to defeat the Demon Lord and simultaneously granting Tachibana's desire.\nTachibana-now in the body of an impossibly perfect woman-has become so attractive that even Jinguuji is captivated. Moreover, Tachibana grows aware of Jinguuji's stunning appearance, finally understanding his popularity. Before they fall in love with each other, the duo must complete their mission or risk remaining prisoners to their infatuations forever.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When he finally regains consciousness, Ojisan begins to ramble in a foreign tongue and reveals that he had been transported to a magical world called Gran Bahamal. Takafumi dismisses his uncle's claims as nonsense until an incantation makes a cup of water hover in the air. In a flash of brilliance, the pair creates a YouTube channel to showcase Ojisan's magical abilities.\nThe responsibility now falls on Takafumi's shoulders to acquaint Ojisan with everything that has transpired during his absence, including getting him up to speed with the internet, new technology, and surprisingly, the outcome of the '90s console war-the result of which was especially distressing for a hardcore SEGA fan. With Ojisan's wisdom from his other world experiences, they grow their YouTube channel and tackle online comments and trolls. The journey of this uncle-nephew duo promises to be anything but conventional.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To honor her legacy, he has dedicated his research to developing new medications for such conditions. But as fate would have it, he overworks himself and passes away at the age of 31, only to be given a second chance at life in another world.\nWhen he wakes up, Kanji finds himself in the body of a 10-year-old boy named Falma de M&eacute;dicis, the son of an esteemed family of medical practitioners in the Sain Fleuve Empire. Bearing the mark of a deity's divine blessing, Falma is capable of performing a unique divine art, allowing him to create and reduce any substance with the knowledge of its chemical properties.\nAfter reading through some pharmacology books, Falma realizes that this world is operating on similar medical practices as in ancient times. He also learns that medicine is an exclusive privilege to the nobility, depriving commoners of proper medical care. Using the knowledge from his past life and the divine abilities granted to him, Falma resolves to make medicine available to those who need it-irrespective of class.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He is joined by his ever-reliable companions: self-absorbed goddess Aqua, one-trick pony arch-wizard Megumin, and masochistic crusader Lalatina Ford \"Darkness\" Dustiness. Following their recent exploits, the party is one step closer to vanquishing the Demon King and his armies-a terrifying task that Kazuma is eager to ignore for as long as possible. Things, however, are not going as smoothly as the group would like; they are constantly racking up debt, getting sidetracked during missions, and falling into traps due to their recklessness and eccentricities.\nAs the party struggles with their perennial issues, they receive an invitation from a princess interested in hearing tales of the group's \"heroic\" deeds. Darkness' pleas to refuse the invitation only fire the others up to accept it, marking the start of yet another uncanny adventure with unforeseen consequences.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Such an opportunity arrives when he is transported to another world alongside Kazuki Ryuusen and Suzune Inukami, two prodigious members of his school's student council. Arriving in Llinger Kingdom, the three are deemed to be the heroes tasked with stopping the impending invasion by the Demon Lord's army. However, this is a misunderstanding-Usato was summoned by accident and, unlike his two friends, is not one of the heroes.\nDespite this disheartening revelation, Usato learns that he has an aptitude for the extremely rare healing magic. This catches the attention of Rose, the intimidating captain of the kingdom's Rescue Team, who forcibly takes custody of Usato to mold him into a full-fledged healer. As he undergoes grueling training under Rose's supervision, Usato resolves to become capable enough to protect his friends from the dangers of this world.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After countless days of grinding, he finally manages to beat it, but his hardcore gaming comes at a cost: extreme sleep deprivation and hunger.\nWhile heading out to the convenience store to solve one of these problems, the man tumbles down the stairs and falls unconscious, only to wake up to the worst possible realization-he has been reincarnated into the game as the mob character Leon Fou Bartfort. Now trapped in a world he despises, Leon must use his knowledge of the game to navigate through the plot safely and sustain himself in a society where the odds are heavily stacked against him.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He quickly gathers that he has turned into a pig and is now in a strange fantasy land. As he struggles to grasp reality, a young girl named Jess comes to his aid. Jess happens to be a Yesma-a discriminated class of servants distinguished by their telepathic abilities and the silver collars around their necks. Despite his inappropriate thoughts about her, Jess makes sacrifices for his sake, and the pig resolves to repay her the best he can within the limits of his new body.\nBut Jess' generosity does not absolve her from the prejudice the Yesmas face daily, and the pig begins to suspect that Jess is in greater danger than she thinks. While he wants to visit the royal capital and beg the king to change him back into a human, the pig realizes that he cannot simply turn his back on his kind savior.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Nevertheless, it is due to her strength and kindness that many girls from different backgrounds-including the dragon Laika, the elf Halkara, the demon queen Pecora, and even the anthropomorphized slime girls Falfa and Shalsha-are all drawn to her. With her ever-growing circle of companions, Azusa's laid-back adventures are far from over-and with even more girls appearing on her doorstep, her already enjoyable life is slated to become even livelier!\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As a bonus, the goddess facilitating his rebirth, Melfina, offers him a choice of any companion to give him a head start in his summoner role. Kelvin-who has fallen head over heels for Melfina at first sight-promptly chooses the deity, confident that his passionate feelings for her will resurface even without all of his memories.\nKelvin embarks on his exciting new journey with Melfina as his guide. However, in order to summon his beloved goddess' physical form, he needs to acquire significant amounts of mana points-and the best way to accomplish this is to level up by fighting strong enemies and making contracts with even stronger companions.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately, his joy is short-lived, as Eris suddenly abandons him to embark on her own journey. Believing that Eris has lost all interest in him, a heartbroken and depressed Rudeus sets forth to the Northern Territories. With his sole goal being to locate his mother on the vast continent, Rudeus wonders if persisting through daily life is worth the pain, falling into a robotic routine as he endlessly ruminates on his lost love.\nHowever, the dangers of the North soon prove that one cannot survive with a dulled mind.

After months of relentless fighting against monsters, Sei can finally relax and continue her study at the Medicinal Flora Research Institute. Although her relationship with Albert Hawke, the commander of the Third Order of Knights, gradually blossoms, her bachelorette status attracts unwanted attention from other men-much to Albert's dismay.\nMoreover, Tenyuu-one of the many princes from the faraway Zaidera Empire-has taken an interest in Slantania and its powerful healing potions. Given that Sei's identity is a national secret, she must lay low in the royal palace until Tenyuu satisfies his curiosity at the institute and returns to his country. Despite his unimpressive appearance, the foreign prince is far from clueless. He has come to Slantania for a clear reason, and Sei's unique skills may just hold the answer to his cryptic research.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Armed with his trusty smartphone, the teenager accepts small quests at his leisure while spending time with his new fianc&eacute;es: Yumina Urnea Belfast, Yae Kokonoe, and twin sisters Linse and Elze Shileska. But even in a relaxing environment, Touya is only beginning to understand the responsibilities that come with these engagements.\nIn addition to his romantic woes, the elder fairy Lean wishes to locate the remaining pieces of Babylon, the floating island that the mysterious Professor Regina Babylon created five thousand years ago. Touya reluctantly accepts her request and seeks out the teleportation circles that will lead to the islands. However, strange monsters have emerged-possibly powerful enough to destroy the world. In order to save the second life he was given, Touya must weaponize ancient technologies to fight these monsters-all while balancing his overwhelming number of relationships.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, Ryouta is given a second chance at life: he wakes up in another world as a slime drop-much to the surprise of Emily Brown, the petite blonde girl who defeated said slime.\nAcquainting himself with the rules of this RPG-like world, Ryouta finds out that he will never grow past level 1. However, he also discovers that one of his skills is at the maximum level: the skill which determines the rarity of monster drops. This allows him to acquire not only items of the best quality, but also some that are unheard of.\nRyouta sets out to make the most of his ability-meeting new friends, grinding through dungeons, and acquiring unique items along the way. Reveling in his new life seems to be the long-awaited and much-deserved reward for all the tribulations he had suffered.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Deemed an adventurer by the local priestess Annette, Sensei is given the daunting mission of slaying the demon king.

Grateful for his actions, Tama decides to escort him. The pair are soon joined by Annette who, seduced by the writer's strong personality, has sworn to protect Sensei's life.\nAs the unlikely trio wander the dangerous, monster-infested lands, they soon realize that human beings might be the true threats to the peace of the world-and Sensei might be the only one with the power to stop them.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Not only do the gods fill him in on the circumstances of his reincarnation, but they also give Cain their respective divine protections-allowing him to use cheat-like abilities in swordsmanship, magic, and many other aspects.\nWith these blessings, Cain sets out to live a fulfilling life that he deems a dream come true. However, it soon becomes clear that the gods have more plans for him than just a haphazard bestowal of overwhelming power.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Also at odds with her goal is the fact that Anis is incapable of using magic despite her noble status. Refusing to give up so easily, she renounces her right to the throne, and focuses on developing \"magicology\" by combining various resources with knowledge from her previous life on Earth.\nDue to Anis' nature, responsibility for the kingdom's future is passed onto her younger brother, Algard. Pushed into a political marriage with Euphyllia Magenta, a girl he hardly knows, Algard rebels by spending more time with a commoner girl than his fianc&eacute;e. After Euphyllia tries to intervene, Algard publicly calls off their marriage and denounces his ex-fianc&eacute;e as a bully.\nAfter crashing into the banquet where Algard makes the announcement, Anis rescues Euphyllia on the flying broom she is testing. She decides to make Euphyllia her assistant, which the other girl reluctantly agrees to. Although their partnership appears random at first, Anis has an ulterior motive for wanting Euphyllia's company.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Just when he reaches his breaking point, a flicker of hope appears in the form of a hidden door in his bathroom.\nThis door provides two-way access to an abandoned house in another world, where he instantly gains game-like stats and skills. Moreover, the house once belonged to a sage, which gives Yuuya access to remarkable weapons, equipment, and crops with extraordinary effects. With these newfound blessings, the once-undesirable Yuuya may just reach his true potential and become unstoppable.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although she grants him overpowered magical abilities in this new world, when he awakes as the newborn Prince Reinhardt, his talents are only measured at Level 2. Thinking their child to be an abysmal failure, his royal parents abandon him in the woods. There, the prince, who names himself Haruto, encounters Flay, a Flame Fenrir who decides to devote her life in service to him. Haruto's relative, Gold Zenfis, meets them both in the woods and decides to adopt the child as his own.\nNine years pass with Haruto under the care of the Zenfis family. His mastery over his overpowered barrier magic increases by the day, though Haruto would rather not use it to help others. He practices his magic in secret, preferring to have his family believe that he is weak. However, his younger sister, Charlotte, discovers his strength, and with the assistance of Flay, Haruto protects her and the rest of the Zenfis family from harm. With a shifty plot stirring in the kingdom, Haruto only wishes to stay inside and watch anime, but it seems he will have to use his magic to keep the family that took him in safe.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Born into a loving family, Femicia appears to have a bright future ahead of her. When she finally turns five, the time comes to go to the church to have her skills appraised. However, while she does receive a monster tamer skill, it turns out that Femicia has zero stars for that ability. To make matters worse, society considers those who have zero stars to be harbingers of misfortune; as a result, Femicia is shunned by everyone-including her family.\nSoon enough, Femicia is chased out of her village and is constantly on the run. Fearing for her life, she decides to masquerade as a boy and change her name to Ivy. With a goal given to her by a fortune teller to reach the royal capital, Ivy meets and successfully tames a slime, starting an unlikely friendship that may provide a means to get the destiny she deserves.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After her long workdays, Rei immerses herself in the world of her favorite dating sim, Revolution, as a student at Bauer Kingdom's prestigious Royal Academy. Instead of focusing on the male love interests, Rei obsesses over the romantic rival: the game's villainess, Claire Fran&ccedil;ois. One evening, however, Rei's exhaustion catches up with her and she passes away.\nWhen Rei opens her eyes again, she finds herself reincarnated as Rae and in the presence of her beloved Claire. Given this miraculous opportunity, she wastes no time declaring her love for the golden-haired villainess and her endearing attempts at bullying. Winning Claire's heart is no easy feat, especially as the game persistently throws the three male leads at Rae-but she has no intention of allowing the dating sim logic to come between her and the one she truly loves.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Hunting Elisabeth down serves as the perfect opportunity for Claire to prove her true mettle. On the other hand, Cid has different objectives-sneaking away from Claire's sight, collecting as much loot as possible, and making Shadow's glorious entrance at the perfect moment.\nAs Elisabeth's awakening draws near, her subordinate Crimson enacts a treacherous plot, sending the town into a frenzy. Searching for her now-missing brother, Claire finds an unexpected ally in Mary, a vampire hunter, and the pair hurry to the Crimson Tower-the home of the Blood Queen. Meanwhile, Beta and a small team of Shadow Garden recruits also arrive at the Lawless City. As the key players converge on the Crimson Tower, the stage is set for a grand confrontation under the crimson moon.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While attempting to fix a distortion in the space-time continuum, the god managing Earth made a mistake that resulted in Kaoru's death. Fortunately, the god preserves her mind and soul, granting her a second chance at life in another world, Verny.\nTo make up for this divine error, Verny's goddess Celestine provides Kaoru with various blessings: a youthful body, proficiency in all languages, an item box with infinite storage, and-most importantly-the ability to spontaneously create any kind of potion, limited only by her imagination. However, her powers prove too advanced for a medieval world like Verny. As she tries to enjoy her new life and escape those who covet her abilities, Kaoru travels across different nations-but the bits of influence she leaves behind may soon amass into something out of control.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "The beginning of Light Magic and the Hero, an otome RPG, unfolds fairly normally: the heroine, Alicia Ehnleit, meets her three love interests one after another and then inevitably comes face-to-face with the villainess. Yumiella Dolkness may be of noble descent, but her dark hair and rare dark-type magic-both associated with the Demon Lord-spark fear in anyone who sees her. When she is five years old, Yumiella regains memories of her previous life in modern Japan, also realizing that her fate is to become the hidden boss that appears after Alicia and her suitors defeat the Demon Lord.\nYumiella refuses to live as the game dictates and, as she prefers the game's fantasy elements over its romance, she decides to cultivate her magical skills and level up in secret. However, everything falls apart on the day of the Royal Academy's entrance ceremony. Yumiella's powers are measured at level 99-something thought impossible even for the royal knights, let alone a 15-year-old girl. With the royal family requesting her help, and everyone else insisting that she prove her strength, Yumiella realizes that her dream of a quiet life is no longer an option.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As Ars grows older and learns more and more about his new environment, he becomes convinced that war will soon erupt.\nFortunately, though Ars was not blessed with unrivaled strength or extraordinary magical aptitude, he does possess Appraisal: a seemingly unique skill that allows him to instantly grasp someone's current abilities and latent talents merely by looking at them. In an effort to prepare his domain for the imminent strife, Ars resolves to enlist the most exceptional people he can find, paying no attention to superficial qualities like race or social status.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately for them, though the jester manages to escape, the night ends with Harley being captured by a mysterious, katana-wielding woman.\nMeanwhile, Amanda Waller, the head of the government security organization A.R.G.U.S., has commandeered a team of supervillains for a ruthless mission into another world. After losing contact with the first suicide squad sent through the portal, Amanda sends Deadshot, Peacemaker, Clayface, King Shark, and Harley as replacements. However, shortly after entering the portal, their helicopter crashes in the middle of a battle between horse-mounted troops and vicious orcs.\nWith all of the accompanying A.R.G.U.S. members dead on impact, the villains break free of their shackles and rampage through the army of orcs, unwittingly aiding the human soldiers-only to be rewarded with imprisonment. Now bound by magic-infused shackles, Harley and company must hurry back to the portal they came from, or else the bombs A.R.G.U.S. implanted in their necks will detonate.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After enrolling into the University of Magic as he was told, Rudeus reunites with his childhood friend Sylphiette, who put a valiant effort into curing his condition. The two grow ever closer together and decide to host a wedding party, inviting the friends they have made over the years to announce and formalize their relationship.\nFor all his recent blessings, however, Rudeus' troubles are far from over. The research he is helping Shizuka Nanahoshi conduct hits a bottleneck, sending her into a deep slump much like he experienced in his previous life. Furthermore, a letter from his father, Paul, brings complications to Rudeus' relationships, and Sylphiette still knows next to nothing about his real background. In the face of these issues, Rudeus will have to apply the lessons he has learned in this new world to navigate through the challenges that come with living a life to its fullest.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "The kind and compassionate heroine of an otome game may be as flawless as she is admirable, but a certain young woman from Japan much prefers the villainess, Alicia Williams. She sees sense in Alicia's ruthless verbal abuse and values her discipline and fortitude. On the other hand, aside from always toying with Prince Duke Seeker's emotions, the commoner heroine seems to only spout lip service.\nGiven the choice, the young woman would love to be reincarnated as Alicia-and her wish suddenly comes true! Seven-year-old Alicia awakens with the memories of her past life, now aware of all the future events, outcomes, and the world's secrets. She has no fear; to outsmart the heroine and avoid a bad ending, all Alicia needs is hard work, mastery of her noble family's dark magic, and the determination to become the greatest villainess in history.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "When a humble merchant named Banaza is summoned to the magical kingdom of Klyrode in another world, the citizens hope he will become the hero who can take down the threatening Dark Army. Unfortunately, Banaza does not gain any exceptional powers at level one as hero candidates usually do, and he has no way of returning to his old world. As compensation, he is sent to live in a faraway forest. Upon arriving, Banaza levels up once and suddenly gains limitless powers that he now has no idea what to do with.\nTo avoid drawing attention, Banaza changes his appearance and assumes the name Flio. While away from home, he stumbles across a young demi-human girl named Fenrys, who is seemingly searching for the same forest Flio was sent to. However, she attacks him and reveals her true identity-a lupine demon. Luckily, Filo's unrivaled magic overpowers Fenrys, and she swears undying loyalty to him. However, Flio refuses to hold power over her; the two instead begin pretending to be a married couple and embark on a new life together.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

During his journey throughout different lands, he has even befriended the mythical wolf Fel and a slime named Sui. While enjoying a meal one day, the trio is interrupted by a tiny but rare pixie dragon who also wants a bite of their food. Like Fel and Sui, the dragon immediately falls in love with Mukouda's cooking and decides to become the man's familiar, receiving the name Dora-chan.\nHowever, cooking is not Mukouda's only forte. His familiars' incredible strength constantly attracts the attention of guilds who ask for their help on different quests. In exchange, the guilds are able to process the game Mukouda and his familiars hunt, enabling their growing party to sample various kinds of monster meat. Continuing to travel around the world with his familiars, Mukouda always comes up with new mouth-watering recipes that will leave everyone hoping for a second serving.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He can return to reality by falling asleep or dying, and he can pick up where he left off by sleeping again. For years, he has had many adventures alongside Mariabelle, a beautiful elf who works for the Sorcery Guild.\nOn one of their escapades, they come across the lair of a dragon taking care of its eggs. They inadvertently wake the slumbering beast, who promptly reduces them to ashes. For Kazuhiro, it is merely a temporary setback, as he can simply go back. However, he is shocked to find Mariabelle herself safe and sound asleep next to him.\nKazuhiro realizes that his dream world is an alternate reality altogether. In the meantime, he makes the most of this bizarre circumstance, introducing Mariabelle to the sights and wonders of Japan. Now, with their time together spanning two worlds, their real adventures have just begun!\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After being hit by a truck, Kenzaburou lands in that exact situation. However, what baffles him is the fact he wound up in the world of an otome game-as the young villainess and the daughter of a duke, Grace Auvergne.\nFortunately for Kenzaburou, he is somewhat familiar with his new world, as it is based on the game called Magical Academy: Love & Beast. He was a proud father in his previous life, and he often listened to his daughter rave about the game's setting and characters. Armed with background knowledge and a lifetime's worth of dad skills, Kenzaburou strives to make the most of his new life, though his kind-hearted nature makes it difficult to fully embrace the role of a villainess.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, the spirit who fought by Rovel's side, Lady Origin, brought him to her realm to save him from the clutches of death. Lady Origin, who happens to be the Queen of the Spirit Realm as well as Ellen's eventual mother, is one of the most powerful spirits in existence, making little Ellen quite powerful in contrast to her innocent looks.\nBut even a family as happy as this one has its fair share of problems, as Ellen and her parents are forced to reconnect their old ties to the Vankreift household in order to defend their relatives' honor-all while hiding Ellen's dangerous existence from the public to preserve their undisturbed happiness.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "When loner Touka Mimori is summoned to another world alongside his classmates, he obtains the power to inflict status ailments, such as paralysis or poison, on his enemies. Unfortunately for him, skills of this nature are considered useless due to their low success rate, and Touka is thus assigned the title of E-rank hero. Things take a further turn for the worse when Vicius, the goddess who summoned the class, reveals that the lowest-ranked hero will be disposed of so that they do not hinder those with greater talent.\nBanished to a notoriously dangerous area, Touka comes face-to-face with death after being cornered by a minotaur-like creature. In a desperate attempt to survive, he uses his supposedly worthless skill-only to quickly realize that it works almost every time. Armed with the ability to render the monsters standing in his way completely helpless, Touka resolves to track down the goddess that tossed him aside and exact his revenge.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

His favorite faction within the game-Mynoghra-was infamously complex to navigate and skewed toward evil; moreover, he insisted on playing at the highest difficulty.\nAfter his untimely death, Takuto awakens in a world uncannily reminiscent of Eternal Nations. He is reincarnated as the King of Ruin, sovereign of Mynoghra itself. At his side stands Odei no Atou, the default hero unit of his chosen nation. Remembering every battle they fought together, she pledges unwavering loyalty to Takuto once more.\nAs Takuto begins to build Mynoghra from scratch in this new world, his early-game strategy remains unchanged: lie low, avoid war, and ensure survival at all costs-ironic for an evil ruler meant to conquer the world. When he offers refuge to persecuted Dark Elves fleeing destruction, a fledgling empire born of a darkness the world has yet to understand begins to take shape.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Shion eagerly anticipates using magical powers, but he discovers that the new world seemingly does not have any magic. He spends the ensuing years as a gloomy and dejected child until a mystical phenomenon at a nearby lake catches the siblings' attention and breathes life back into his magical dream.\nWhile experimenting on the peculiar light emanating from the water, Shion finally confirms that magical energy really exists. It may not be convenient for anything just yet, but Shion devotes his time to studying the anomaly, determined to uncover all the existing wonders in his quest to make magic.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With rising dissension among the demon army and failing negotiations with other tribes, it is up to Uchimura to justify the faith bestowed upon him and bring one final push for the Demon Lord's vision of dominance and perfection.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Lufas journeys through Exgate, looking for the long-disbanded Twelve Stars of Heaven.\nLufas is without country, army, or allies. A question remains: what is the real reason an ordinary man was reincarnated into Exgate as Lufas?\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Amid his efforts to save her, the two are transported to another world. He soon learns that the people in this world summoned a saint to save their kingdom from a plague.

To enhance the capabilities of his super-powered robot, he painstakingly unearthed a mysterious ancient treasure from the abyss-the Eye of the Ancestral Dragon. Just as he was about to transfer the Eye's energy into his robot, the divine power within was accidentally activated, triggering a spacetime vortex that transported Lin Feng to an ancient god-like continent that revered martial arts, where he was reborn.\nThe reborn Lin Feng had his memories of his past life sealed, becoming an ordinary person who only awakened a healing-type martial soul. He faced cold shoulders and even had his fiancee break off their engagement. His fiancee's clan, determined to eliminate any future threats, ruthlessly attacked and killed him. In this moment of crisis, Lin Feng awakened his memories of the Eye of the Ancestral Dragon and was overjoyed to discover that its divine power had successfully fused with his super-powered robot. Subsequently, with the robot's assistance, he gradually mastered the Eye of the Ancestral Dragon's power and embarked on the path to becoming a powerful figure.\n(Source: Bangumi, translated)",

Having fallen in love with her, he promises her on their 1,999th meeting that he will be the one to save her the next time. But a motorcycle accident sends Takeru to Denji Heian-kyo-an alternate version of Japan's ancient capital with futuristic technology and the home of the girl from his dreams, Tsukiyima, who does not recognize him.\nHowever, a black mist soon descends upon the city, petrifying citizens and unleashing monsters called oni. Only the so-called onmyouji-sorcerers who wield mystical powers and pilot magical \"shikigami\" suits-can fight them. When the mist returns, Takeru discovers that he has strange transformation powers and can resist the oni. But he and Tsukimiya are ultimately killed, and Takeru awakens in Denji Heian-kyo once again, this time two weeks before the appearance of the mist. Swearing to protect Tsukimiya at all costs, Takeru vows to become an onmyouji and change the future.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This playboy prince saves the witch Anna at an execution scene and is shocked to discover that magic really exists in this medieval-style otherworld.\nWhen Anna, as a witch, displays her magical skills, Roland realizes that magic can replace some modern technology, so he formulates a \"great development of magical industry\" plan. Thus, in an era where everyone hates witches, the independent Roland begins to recruit witches, using their magic to transform Border Town and improve the lives of himself and the locals.\nIn addition to using magic to develop industry, Roland also introduces modern business ideas to Border Town. Under Roland's leadership, people manufacture firearms, and Roland gains public support. As the number of witches in Roland's camp increases, the magical industry continues to improve. At the same time, Roland will face battles with great families and other princes and princesses.\nAs his territory expands, Roland successfully creates a harmonious coexistence between witches and ordinary people, gradually bringing the western territory of Graycastle and even the entire kingdom under his rule, and slowly uncovering the secrets of the devil race and the Witch Empire.\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

    "synopsis": "Minoru Kido, age 30, cause of death: traffic accident. As a Japanese, I died without leaving any evidence of my life. At the time of my death, I was thinking, \"Next time, I want to live a long life and leave behind some proof of my life,\" when I was reincarnated as an elf with a life span of 1,000 years! That's why I made a vow. I vowed that this time I would spend my whole life living in a way that would leave a mark on my life.\nAt the age of 20, I was able to use all of the healing magic that elves were originally equipped with at will. By the age of 30, I had mastered all attribute magic, and by the age of 100, I had deciphered all the ancient magic formulas. For the remaining 900 years of my life, all I have to do is run out of the Elven forest and become a warrior.\nOne day, I'll be missed by a fledgling adventurer who will eventually be called a hero. Sometimes, a country is founded in my name. Sometimes, I was called the founder of magic and became an object of worship. This is the story of a reincarnated elf who roars his name into history as a living legend.\n(Source: Kakuyomu, translated)",
